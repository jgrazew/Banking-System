# Banking-System
A simple banking system that allows the user to create and manage accounts.
This program was just done so that I could practice my skills in C++. It would not be able to be used for production.
The file stores all created objects in a vector. The program also allows you to save the objects into a text file. If I wanted to take 
this project just one step further I would use ifstream and stringstream to load in data then append it.
